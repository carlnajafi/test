Creating illusions, how to make materials resemble one another. How to create a sense of a different material.
A focus on specific, imagined scenes or places where layer after layer are presented side by side. It is seen from above or from the sides. As a platform game or as a two-dimensional scenery.
I'm working with colors and patterns to make them vibrant, letting them be free to move out from the paper and then be transformed into hypnotic landscapes.

Materials in constant flux, they oxidize, melt and connect, deflect and repel.
A composition that repeats over an entire surface. Possibly streching out to infinity.
It is hard to know the exact scale of what you're looking at, it could be microscopic, but it could also be just as big as you see it.
Maybe you could see it as a fictional story of the Earth genesis and its resources that are stored beneath us, what is in us and how it is continuously changing.
Interwoven with something more contemporary(???), the time we live in right now, which to me feels almost electrified, loaded with things you can not yet know the outcome of. Nanoparticles, new chemical processes, mixtures of minerals and metals, new elements.

I am also interested in that which may be seen as a bit cheap and ugly. Everything from plastic jewlery to Happy Meal toys. That the objects and patterns are trying to emulate their opposites but without success. A bit like the feeling I have for costume jewelery. It is in some ways both obvious and vulgar, yet uncertain of its desire to be something it is not, which is somewhat touching.
My gem stones are a bit like that I guess, vulgar and obvious, and yet they are constantly in a state of change. They seem to be looking for their proper shape, finding someting to emulate and thus finding their rightful place. At the same time, they are probably pretty restless, not bothered to be perfect just for the sake of perfection and there is probably a strong desire to be for the sake of being.
