Creating illusions, how to make a material to resemble one another. Or how to create a sense of a different material.
An adherence (a fixation) to specific, imagined scenes or locations where layer after layer are presented side by side. It is seen from above or from the side. As a platform game or as a two-dimensional scenery.
I'm working with colors and patterns to make them seem vibrant, to almost feel them move out from the paper and then be transformed into hypnotic landscapes.
At a first glance my work might feel just playful and naïve in the crude and slightly comical way of the lines. But then the graphic, monocromatic, and opaque appears alongside that playfulness and the image suddenly take an other turn and you realise that there are other levels lingering underneath. 

Materials in change, they oxidize, melt and connect to each other (and repel each other).
A composition that repeats over the entire surface. Like it is then possible it could continue so indefinitely. 
It is hard to know the exact scale of that you're looking at, it could be microscopic, but it could also be just as big as you see it.
Maybe you could see it as a fictional story of the Earth genesis and its resources that are stored beneath us, what is in us and how it is continously changing.
Interwoven with something more contemporary, the time we live in right now, which to me feels almost electrified, loaded with things you can not yet know the outcome of. Nanoparticles, new chemical processes, mixtures of minerals and metals, the elements.

I am also interested in what is a little bit cheap and ugly. Things that are human made. That it or something, is trying to emulate it's opposite but without success. It's somewhat touching. A bit like the feeling I have for costume jewelery. It is in some ways both obvious and vulgar, yet uncertain of their desire to be something it is not.
My gem stones are a bit so I guess, vulgar and obvious, and yet they are constantly in a kind of change, looking for its proper shape, looking at what is noble to perhaps emulate that, and thus find their rightful place. At the same time, they are probably pretty restless, bothered not to be perfect just for perfects sake and there is probably a strong desire to be just for its own sake.
